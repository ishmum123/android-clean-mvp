# android-clean-mvp

This project aims to provide a clean android architecture which mimics a website. There is only one Activity
and several fragments. The views "in-page" are handled by the fragments themselves as much as possible. The 
interactions which require data passes user interaction to the "Presenter" which decides what data to send
or which fragment to open. In sha Allah this would prove beneficial.
